# FindPlayer

Use this plugin on your minecraft spigot server to add a command to locate players on your server.
It will show their coordinates, world and more.
If the target user is offline (and logging is enabled) it will show where they last were.

Includes optional integration into WorldGuard and will display whichever regions the player is in.

## Configuration

Nothing special needed.  Just place the .jar file into your plugins directory and restart the server.
by default it will log to a json file so player's last location will be logged.
Logging options include: mysql, json or none.
